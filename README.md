What is PPTP VPN (Virtual Private Network)?
----------------

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a method for implementing virtual private networks. PPTP uses a control channel over TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to encapsulate PPP packets.  

For more information on PPTP; please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol

**Note:**  PPTP is not the most secure VPN; however, please consider than any VPN is better than none.  For more information on PPTP security; please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol#Security
